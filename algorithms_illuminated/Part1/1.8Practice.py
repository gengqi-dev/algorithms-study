# 1.1
# Fast forward to the moment after the two outermost recursive calls complete, but before the final Merge step.  Thinking of the two 5-element output arrays of the recursive calls as a glued-together 10-element array, which number is in the 7th position?
# A: 2
# 5 3 8 9 1 7 0 2 6 4
# A: 7th is 2

# 1.2 Consider the following modification to the MergeSort algorithm: divide the input array into thirds (rather than halves), recursively sort each third, and finally combine the results using a three-way Merge subroutine. What is the running time of this algorithm as a function of the length n of the input array, ignoring constant factors and lower-order terms? [Hint: Note that the Merge subroutine can still be implemented so that the number of operations is only linear in the sum of the input array lengths.]
